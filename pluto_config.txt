# Configuration file for the Pluto driver

# UDP_IPADDRESS is the IP address of the computer where the application is running
# if deactivated then all runs on the local PC
# not used in crossband repeater mode, since this mode does not have an application
UDP_IPADDRESS 127.0.0.1

# === Pluto identification ===
# Pluto connected via USB:
#   SN of the pluto
#   check the SN with this command: iio_info -s
#   (look for the long ID number i.e.: 1044730a199700191f001800f3647c5341)
# if only one pluto is conncted, leave this empty, the pluto will be detected automatically
#
# Pluto connected via Ethernet:
#   enter Pluto's IP address in this format:  ip:192.168.1.2
PLUTO_ID    ip:192.168.10.25

# === TX frequency ===
# this is the transmission frequency of the Pluto
TX_FREQ     435.450

# === RX freuquency ===
# this is the RX frequency of the Pluto
RX_FREQ     739.450

# === TX power ===
# this is the transmission power setting for the Pluto in dBm
# maximum output power: 0
# usually use something between -20 and -5
# Attention: if using a PTT circuit on GPO0/GPO1 this value must be > -25 to get the PTT working
TX_GAIN     -25

# === RX and TX sample rate ===
# enter in MHz
SAMPLERATE  1.2

# === TX and RX bandwidth ===
# usually half the samplerate or a bit higher
TX_BANDWIDTH    1
RX_BANDWIDTH    1

# === crossband repeater ===
# 0 ... normal mode (using an application for sample processing)
# 1 ... crossband repeater mode, send all data which are received without any change
CROSSBANDREPEATER 1
