* =====================================================================
* the purpose of this driver is to have a very easy to use plattform
* for receiving and transmitting data via the Adalm-Pluto.
*
* This is a stand alone program. It connects to the pluto and handles
* all RX and TX.
* The final data are transfered to/from the application via an UDP port
* The application has nothing to do with the Pluto, it just streams
* the data via UDP
* =====================================================================
